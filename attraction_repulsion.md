## Same charge repel each other opposite charges attract

This is one of he base rules we have learned, but how can this be explained by the ethereal flow?

Lets start with coulombs law:

$F=\mu_0.c^2\frac{q_1.q_2}{r^2}$ with $\mu_0 = 10^{-7}$ we can state that:

$10^{-7}.F = c^2\frac{q_1.q_2}{r^2}$ if we make the calculation for two equal charges, we can even reduce the formula to:

$10^{7}.F = (\frac{c.q}{r})^2$ Basically this is the same as we did earlier in the chapter of the charges, but it gives a better view where we want to end. The expressed force is
