## Heat as a need for ether

The  main question here is if we can express temperature as an effect of the ether. First it has to be clarified. The models used in the charge, are models where the ether is present in 'free space', without taking in account the influence of other charges. In reality this is not the case, and especially in case of experiments on the surface of the earth.

When we go even deeper into the earth, most of the ether will be consumed by the surrounding matter. In this condition the ethereal inflow is not enough to provide the necessary fuel for the charges.  

First let us look at the units of the ideal gas law:

$p.V = n.R.T$

with:

- $p$ the pressure Pa ($\frac{N}{m^2}$)
- $V$ the volume in $m^3$
- $n$ the amount of substance of the gas in moles  (= number of molecules divided by Avogadro's number)
- $R$ the universal gas constant (8,314462 $\frac{J}{K.mol}$)
- $T$ the absolute temperature in (K)

In formulas a constant points mainly to a scalar to fit a formula to the real measurements. In this case it is not different. 
When taking in account the number of moles is just a number and the universal gas constant is just a scalar, they will have no units. 
To obtain the units we can just ignore them in the formula.

$p.V \sim T \rightarrow \frac{N}{m^2}.m^3 \rightarrow \frac{m^4} {s^2.m^2}.m^3 \rightarrow \frac{m^5}{s^2} = (J)$

This states that temperature **has the same** unit as **energy**. 

## Cold points to abundance of ether

When a charge receives enough 'fuel' it will go to its most stable state, which is reached at **zero Kelvin**,  the **absolute zero temperature**. A higher temperature indicates a reduction of 'fuel'. 

This is totally in contrary to the currently accepted scientific approach, and to the basic understanding.

**Higher temperature means a search for ether**, charges will move in the direction of the highest 'fuel'-density due to an imbalance in delivery of the 'fuel'. The lack of mass produces an acceleration of $\infty$ to a velocity of the speed of light $c$.

> Colder temperatures than the coldest place in space can be achieved on earth.  This can be a measure for the amount of consumed ether already gone.

> In 1995, using the 15-metre Swedish-**ESO** Submillimetre Telescope in **Chile**, astronomers revealed that it is the coldest place in the Universe found so far, besides laboratory-created temperatures. With a temperature of −272 °C, it is only 1 °C warmer than absolute zero (the lowest limit for all temperatures).

> A combination of lasers and magnets will be used to chill and slow a cloud of atoms to just a fraction above absolute zero, also known as zero Kelvin (**-273.15 Celsius** or **-459.67 Fahrenheit**). Absolute zero is the coldest temperature in the Universe - and impossible to achieve, because at that point, atoms stop moving.







## Heat transfer

Convection or by contact, 



## Friction heat

How can this be explained?

## Considering matter

From thermal physics we know the size of matter depend on the temperature for most materials.

# Matter

Consist of electrons, protons and neutrons which on their part are build up of charges
Matter consumes energy to exist.
Highest energy state at 0K


# Gravity as a measure for consumption
