## The electron

Maybe this can be defined as one of the more elementary elements. 









### Electrical current I

Definition as found on the internet:

> An **electric current** is a flow of electric charge, this charge is often carried by moving **electrons** in a **wire**. It can also be carried by **ions** in an **electrolyte**, or by both ions and electrons such as in an ionised gas (plasma). 

An electric current is indeed a flow of electric charges, but there is **no** way to state that these are electrons are moving in a wire. It is considered that the moving charges are caused by electrons, but this can not be proved. 

Ethereal mecanics describes an electron as build up of two charges, circling arount eachother at the speed of light. It is perfectly possible that the current is carried by one of these charges being replaced by a 'fresh' charge. The electron will remain in its position with respect to the Cu atom, but one of his charges has swapped.
