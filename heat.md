## Heat as an effect of the ether

The  main question here is if we can express temperature as an effect of the ether. First it has to be clarified. The models used in the charge, are models where the ether is present in 'free space', without taking in account the influence of other charges. In reality this is not the case, and especially in case of experiments on the surface of the earth.

When we go even deeper into the earth, most of the ether will be consumed by the surrounding matter. In this condition the ethereal inflow is not enough to provide the necessary fuel for the charges.
